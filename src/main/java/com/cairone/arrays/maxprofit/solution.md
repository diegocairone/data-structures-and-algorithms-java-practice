The maxProfit method calculates the maximum profit that could be made from an array of stock prices, where each element in the array represents the stock price of the day.

The idea is to buy at the lowest price and sell at the highest price afterward, so the method keeps track of the lowest price it has seen and the maximum profit it can get.

Here's how it works:

The method initializes minPrice with Integer.MAX_VALUE, the largest possible integer. This is a common technique when you want to find a minimum value: start with the largest possible value and then update it whenever you find a smaller value.

It also initializes maxProfit as 0. This is the maximum profit that could be made, which obviously cannot be less than 0 (since you can always choose not to buy any stocks).

The method then starts to loop over each price in prices.

In each iteration, it first updates minPrice to be the minimum of minPrice and the current price. This keeps minPrice always as the smallest value seen so far in the array.

It then calculates the potential profit (profit) if selling the stock at the current price. This profit is the difference between the current price and the smallest price seen so far (minPrice).

Next, it updates maxProfit to be the maximum of maxProfit and the just-calculated profit. This keeps maxProfit always as the maximum profit that can be made so far.

After going through all the prices in the array, maxProfit is the maximum profit that can be made from buying on the day with the lowest price and selling on a later day.

Finally, the method returns maxProfit.
