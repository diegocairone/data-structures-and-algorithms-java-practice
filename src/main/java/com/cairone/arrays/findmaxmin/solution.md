The findMaxMin function is designed to find both the maximum and minimum value in an array of integers, myList, and return these two values in a new array.

Here's how it works:

The function starts by initializing two variables, maximum and minimum, to the first element of the input array myList[0]. These two variables are used to keep track of the highest and lowest values found in the array as it's traversed.

Next, the function uses an enhanced for loop (also known as a "for-each" loop) to traverse through the myList array. In this loop, num is a temporary variable that takes on the value of each element in myList, one by one from start to end.

Inside the for loop, there are two if statements:

The first if statement checks if the current element (num) is greater than the current maximum. If it is, then num becomes the new maximum. This way, maximum always holds the highest value encountered so far in the array.

The second if statement, which is the else if, checks if the current element (num) is less than the current minimum. If it is, then num becomes the new minimum. This ensures that minimum always holds the smallest value encountered so far in the array.

After the for loop has finished traversing the array, maximum and minimum will hold the highest and lowest values found in the myList array, respectively.

Finally, the function returns a new array containing the maximum and minimum values. This is done using the syntax new int[] {maximum, minimum}, which creates an anonymous array with two elements.



So for example, if myList was [5, 2, 10, 8, 6], the function would return [10, 2], because 10 is the maximum value in the array and 2 is the minimum value.
