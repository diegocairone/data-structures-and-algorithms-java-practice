Pseudo Code:

Method kthSmallest:

Input: An integer k

Output: The kth smallest value in the binary search tree, or null if k exceeds the number of elements in the tree.

Procedure:

2.1: Initialize an empty stack, stack, to store nodes during in-order traversal of the binary search tree.

2.2: Set node as the root of the binary search tree.

2.3: While loop:

Condition: stack is not empty or node is not null.

Purpose: This loop continues in-order traversal as long as there are nodes left to process.

2.3.1: Nested while loop:

Condition: node is not null.

Purpose: This loop visits the leftmost node of the current subtree.

2.3.1.1: Push node into stack.

2.3.1.2: Move node to its left child.

2.3.2: Pop a node from stack and assign it to node.

2.3.3: Decrease k by 1.

2.3.4: If statement:

Condition: k equals 0.

Purpose: If k equals 0, we have reached the kth smallest node.

2.3.4.1: Return the value of node.

2.3.5: Move node to its right child.

2.4: Return null.

Purpose: This step is reached only when k exceeds the number of elements in the tree.
