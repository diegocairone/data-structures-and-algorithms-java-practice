DLL: Reverse Between ( ** Interview Question)
Reverse a portion of a doubly linked list (DLL).

Write a method that takes two indices (startIndex, endIndex) and reverses the nodes between those indices.

The original list must be modified in place.



Constraints:

startIndex and endIndex are zero-based.

The list may be empty or contain a single node.

If startIndex == endIndex, no changes should occur.

You must maintain the integrity of both next and prev pointers.
