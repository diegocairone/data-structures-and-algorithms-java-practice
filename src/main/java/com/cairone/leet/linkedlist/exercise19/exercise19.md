LL: Swap Nodes in Pairs ( **Interview Question)
LeetCode #24

Write a method swapPairs() inside a LinkedList class that swaps every two adjacent nodes in a singly linked list.

This method should update the linked list in-place by changing the next pointers â€” not by swapping values.

The method should work correctly for:

empty lists,

single-node lists,

even-length lists,

odd-length lists.
